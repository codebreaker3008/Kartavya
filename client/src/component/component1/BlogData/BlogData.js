      title: "IRCS Haryana State Branch to provide door to door facility for oxygen refilling to the needy",
      content: "As hospitals in Haryana and most parts of the country were facing shortage of beds during the second wave of Covid, people were trying to find ways to get treatment for their loved ones at home. Smt. Sharda Sabharwalâ€™s son could not get a hospital bed in his Home town or nearby districts for his 81-year-old mother, a resident of Hudu, Sirsa, Haryana. He ran from one hospital to the other in an attempt to get a bed for his mother as she struggled to breathe. She was diagnosed with Covid-19 positive and her oxygen level had dropped to 60. Oxygen supply became a scarce commodity as number of patients was rising rapidly. He knew that the struggle would be long as there were many others in the queue, each struggling to give their loved ones a fighting chance to survive. He tried his luck by registering on the portal http://oxygenhry.in/ an initiative by Haryana Government in coordination with Haryana Red Cross branch to provide door-to-door facility for oxygen refilling to the needy. This came out to be lifeline for his ailing mother as volunteers from IRCS Haryana reached at his doorsteps with an Oxygen cylinder. Like Sharda, thousands of patients in home isolation were benefited with the introduction of this facility of delivery of filled oxygen cylinders at home. These services were provided free of cost by the volunteers and patients relatives were not wait in line for long hours to refill cylinder during the pandemic.",
